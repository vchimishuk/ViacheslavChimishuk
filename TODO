* Future improvements.
  * Test for every mover implementation.
  * Test for Game class, which can tests checkmate detection, invalid moves handling,
    figure taking, and other situations.
  * I don't like GameState passing through all the methods and I belive it can
    be refactored in such way that movers are created with injected GameState object.
    Or sort of...
  * Commands can be moved out from CLI class, -- generic Command interface and
    separate implementation for every supported command.
    It should be simpler to add new commands support after that.
